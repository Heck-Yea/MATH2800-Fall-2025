\section*{Problem 1}

    \textbf{Result:} The function $ f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z} $, defined by $ f(n) = 5n + 2$ is injective, but not surjective.
    \\
    \textbf{Proof:} We first prove that the function is injective. Let the function $f$ be defined as above, and suppose that $f(x) = f(y)$ for some arbitrary integers $x$ and $y$. From this assumption, we have
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= f(y) \\
        5x + 2 &= 5y + 2 \\
        5x &= 5y \\
        x &= y
    \end{align*}
    By the definition of injective, we have shown that the function $f$ is injective. \\
    To show that $f$ is not surjective, we demonstrate a counterexample. We seek two integers $q, r$ such that $f(q) = r$ has no solution. \\
    Consider $r = 1$. In this case, we have 
    \begin{align*}
        f(q) &= 1 \\
        5n + 2 &= 1 \\
        5n &= -1 \\
        n &= -\frac{1}{5}
    \end{align*}
    Because $-\frac{1}{5}$ is not an integer, we have shown that $f$ is not surjective. \hfill $\Box$

\section*{Problem 2}

    \textbf{Result:} The function $ f : \mathbb{R} - \{2\}\rightarrow \mathbb{R} - \{5\} $ defined by $f(x) = \frac{5x+1}{x-2}$ is bijective.
    \\
    \textbf{Proof:} In order to show bijectivity, we must show that the function defined above is both injective and surjective. We begin by showing injectivity. \\
    Let the function $f$ be defined as above, and suppose that $f(x) = f(y)$ for some arbitrary real numbers $x$ and $y$, excluding $x, y = 2$. From this assumption, we have
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= f(y) \\
        \frac{5x+1}{x-2} &= \frac{5y+1}{y-2} \\
        (5x + 1)(y-2) &= (x-2)(5y+1) \\
        5xy -10x +y -2 &= 5xy +x -10y -2 \\
        -10x +y &= -10y + x \\
        -11x &= -11y \\
        x &= y
    \end{align*}
    By the definition of injective, we have shown that the function $f$ is injective. \\
    We now work to show surjectivity. \\
    Let the function $f$ be defined as above, and suppose two real numbers $q, r$ such that $f(q) = r$. From this supposition, we have
    \begin{align*}
        f(q) &= r \\
        \frac{5q+1}{q-2} &= r \\
        5q+1 &= r(q-2) \\
        5q+1 &= rq -2r \\
        5q - rq &= -2r -1 \\
        (5-r)q &= -2r -1 \\
        q &= \frac{-2r -1}{5-r} \tag{1}
    \end{align*}
    Recall from the definition of the function that the codomain is the set of real numbers, excluding $5$. Since the solution above holds for all real numbers excluding $5$, the function is surjective. \\
    However, we need to check if the integer $q$ can be an element of the domain. We do this using contradiction. Suppose that $q=2$, which is strictly not in the domain. From this, we have
    \begin{align*}
        2 &= \frac{-2r -1}{5-r} \\
        10 - 2r &= -2r - 1 \\
        10 &= -1
    \end{align*}
    which is clearly a contradiction. Thus, the equation found in (1) holds true. \\
    Because the function is both injective and surjective, it is, by definition, bijective. \hfill $\Box$

\section*{Problem 3}

    \textbf{Result:} Let $A$ be a nonempty set and let $f: A \rightarrow A$ be a function. If $f \circ f = i_a$, then $f$ is bijective.
    \\
    \textbf{Proof:} Let $A$ be a nonempty set and let $f: A \rightarrow A$ be a function, and suppose that $f \circ f = i_a$. In order to show that $f$ is bijective, we must show that $f$ is both one-to-one and onto. We start with one-to-one. \\
    Suppose that there are some elements $x, y \in A$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$. We work to show that $x = y$.
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= f(y) \\
        f(f(x)) &= f(f(y))
    \end{align*}
    By the definition of the identity function, we have 
    \begin{align*}
        f(f(x)) &= f(f(y)) \\
        x = y
    \end{align*}
    Thus, $f$ is one-to-one. \\
    We now work to show that $f$ is also onto. Let $r$ be an arbitrary element in $A$, and let another arbitrary element $q \in A$ be such that $f(r) = q$. We know that $q$ exists because $f$ is defined by $f: A \rightarrow A$. Through algebra, we have
    \begin{align*}
        f(r) &= q \\
        f(f(r)) &= f(q) \\
        r &= f(q)
    \end{align*}
    Since we have shown that for an arbitrary element $r$ in the codomain $A$, there exists an element $q$ in the domain $A$ (specifically $q = f(r)$) such that $f(q) = r$, the function $f$ is onto. \\
    Since $f$ is both one-to-one and onto, it is, by definition, bijective. \hfill $\Box$

\section*{Problem 4}

    \textbf{Result:} Let the composition $ g \circ f : (0, 1) \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ of two functions $f$ and $g$ be given by $ (g \circ f)(x) = \frac{4x-1}{2 \sqrt{x-x^2}} $ where $f: (0,1) \rightarrow (-1, 1) $ is defined by $ f(x) = 2x-1 $ for $x \in (0,1) $. The function $g$ is given by $g(y) = \frac{2y-1}{2\sqrt{1-y^2}}$.
    \\
    \textbf{Proof:} Let the function $f$ and the composition $g \circ f$ be defined as above. We work to find the function $g$. \\
    From the definitions above, we have
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= 2x-1 \\
        y &= 2x-1 \\
        y+1 &= 2x \\
        \frac{y+1}{2} &= x \tag{1}
    \end{align*}
    Expression (1) above is the inverse of $f(x)$, or in other words, $f^{-1}(x)$. \\
    Plugging the inverse function into the composition $(g \circ f)(x)$, we will be able to 'undo' the function $f$ to be left with $g$.
    \begin{align*}
        (g \circ f)(x) &= \frac{4x-1}{2 \sqrt{x-x^2}} \\
        g(y) &= \frac{  4(\frac{y+1}{2})-1 }{  2 \sqrt{(\frac{y+1}{2})-(\frac{y+1}{2})^2}  } \\
        g(y) &= \frac{  2y+1 }{  2 \sqrt{1-y^2}  }
    \end{align*}
    Thus, we have our function $g(y) = \frac{  2y+1 }{ 2 \sqrt{1-y^2}}$. \hfill $\Box$

\section*{Problem 5}

    \textbf{Result:} Let $A = \mathbb{R} - \{1\}$ and define $f : A \rightarrow A$ by $f(x) = \frac{x}{x-1}$ for all $x \in A$. When this is the case, then $f$ is bijective, and $f^{-1} = f = \frac{x}{x-1}$.
    \\
    \textbf{Proof:} Let the function $f$ be defined as above. In order to show bijectivity, we must show injectivity and surjectivity. We begin with injectivity. \\
    Suppose there are some elements $x, y \in A$ such that $f(x) = f(y)$. We work to show that $x = y$.
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= f(y) \\
        \frac{x}{x-1} &= \frac{y}{y-1} \\
        x(y-1) &= y(x-1) \\
        xy - x &= xy - y \\
        -x &= -y \\
        x &= y
    \end{align*}
    Thus, $f$ is injective. \\
    To show surjectivity, let $q, r$ be arbitrary elements in $A$ such that $f(q) = r$. We work to show that there exists such a $q$.
    \begin{align*}
        f(q) &= r \\
        \frac{q}{q-1} &= r \\
        q &= (q-1)r \\
        q &= qr - r \\
        0 &= qr - q - r \\
        r &= qr - q \\
        r &= q(r-1) \\
        \frac{r}{r-1} &= q \\
        q &= \frac{r}{r-1} 
    \end{align*}
    Recalling that the domain $A$ is defined by all real numbers, excluding $\{1\}$, we see that there does in fact exist such a $q$. \\
    Since $f$ is both injective and surjective, we have that it is, in fact, bijective. \\
    \\
    In order to find the inverse of $f$, we use algebra. Let $f(x) = y$ and let $x \in A$.
    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= \frac{x}{x-1} \\
        y &= \frac{x}{x-1} \\
    \end{align*}
    Without loss of generality (from the proof of surjectivity), we have
    \begin{align*}
        x &= \frac{y}{y-1} \\
        f^{-1}(x) &= \frac{y}{y-1}
    \end{align*}
    \hfill $\Box$

\section*{Problem 6}

    \textbf{Result:} For every integer $n \geq 28$, there exist nonnegative integers $x$ and $y$ such that 
\begin{align*}
    n = 5x + 8y.
\end{align*}

\textbf{Proof:} We use the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction.

First, we verify the statement for the integers $n = 28, 29, 30, 31,$ and $32$:
\begin{align*}
    28 &= 5(0) + 8(3), \\
    29 &= 5(1) + 8(3), \\
    30 &= 5(6) + 8(0), \\
    31 &= 5(3) + 8(2), \\
    32 &= 5(4) + 8(2).
\end{align*}
Thus, the statement is true for $n = 28, 29, 30, 31,$ and $32$. \\
Now assume that for some integer $k \geq 32$, the statement holds for all integers $m$ satisfying 
\begin{align*}
    28 \leq m \leq k.
\end{align*}
We work to show that the statement holds for $n = k+1$. Since $k \geq 32$, we have
\begin{align*}
    (k+1) - 5 = k - 4 \geq 28.
\end{align*}
By the inductive hypothesis, the integer $k - 4$ can be written as
\begin{align*}
    k - 4 = 5x + 8y
\end{align*}
for some nonnegative integers $x$ and $y$. We add $5$ to both sides:
\begin{align*}
    k+1 &= (k - 4) + 5 \\
        &= 5x + 8y + 5 \\
        &= 5(x+1) + 8y.
\end{align*}
Since $x+1$ and $y$ are nonnegative integers, this expresses $k+1$ in the required form. \\
Therefore, by the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction, every integer $n \geq 28$ can be written as $5x + 8y$ for some nonnegative integers $x$ and $y$. \hfill $\Box$
