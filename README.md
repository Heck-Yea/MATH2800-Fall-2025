# Overview

This repository contains all assignments from MATH2800 - Math Major Seminar.

Nearly all of the work here is in LaTeX.

This was a 2-credit-hour course with a pass/fail grading scheme. There were no exams or projects, only biweekly(ish) assignments.


# Structure

Each folder (A01, A02, etc.) contains the files for each assignment. In, for example, A01, there are several local-operating files, but the important ones are A01.tex and A01.pdf. The .tex file is the LaTeX written for the assignment, and the .pdf file is the result. This is consistent across all assignment folders.
